3.1 Max-Width Media Queries
============================

Create break-points
To know the width of our browser we can use chrome and go to the developer tools and when we resize the browser we can see on the top right of the screen the dimensions there. 

It's better to create break-points based on the content

Media feature:
How the content fits in a space of a browser. Get more specific. Say what it's going to happen at some point with the properties. 

Ex. 
@media (max-width: 960px) {
   section { background-color: red; }
}

=======================================
3.2 Resizing Content Based on the Width
=======================================

A max-width is not so strong as a width.

If we resize a width in a container it changes the all page.

Now that we've created our max-width media query, we're going to use it to adjust our content.

Create several break-points to resize and adapt the content of the page.

3.3 Styling the Menu
=====================

Navigation is often one of the first things that need to be addressed in a responsive website design. In this lesson you’ll begin styling a basic navigation menu in preparation for making it more responsive.

===========================
3.4 Creating a Menu Button
===========================

In this lesson you'll move the main menu off the edge of the browser window. Then you'll create a simple button that will eventually cause our menu to animate back onto the screen.

Create a new nav with a class in HTML. <nav class='small-menu'>
Then create a span with another class. <span class='nav-activate'>
Add the text +Menu

In the styles.css we create a nav.small-menu with the display: none

Then in the media queries we create a nav.small-menu with { 
- display: none; 
- background-color: #777; 
- color: white; 
- width: 100%; (of the width of the browser); 
- box-sizing: content-box; (it's the default value, expand when we add padding to it)
- we can give padding
- position: relative;
- left: negative; (the padding defined)
- text-align: right;
