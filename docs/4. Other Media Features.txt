========================
4.1 Resolution Features
========================

To make images look good in devices with less pixels:

.feature {
background-image: url('.../images/images.jpg'); }

Only browsers like chrome gonna support that option but if we added a ',' e can include a new resulution.
@media 
(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
(min-resolution: 192dpi) {
    .feature { background-image: url('../images/image-hires.jpg') } }

What will be doing is loading a diferent image that's higher resolution that's going to look good on the high resolution displays such as the render display for apple devices. 

================================
4.2 Orientation and Aspect Ratio
================================

Orientation of the screen - landscape or portrait.

We can create a different layout or a different column structure depending on the user is in portrait or landscape mode.

To costumize the break points for the portrait and landscape we can use the aspect-ratio media feature in CSS.

aspect-ratio is based on numbers separated by a slash 
ex. aspect-ratio: 1/1 - it will be a square, width is the same size as the height. This occurs on one specific width and height, for ex. 499px x 499px

If we set to max-aspect-ratio: 1/1 when it comes to 499px x 499px it stays on portrait mode. 

When the width is larger then the height it turns landscape.
When the height is larger then the width it turns portrait.

========================
4.3 More Media Features
========================

@media (min-device-width: 480) { } 
The width looks at the width of the browser.
Device width is the width of the device that we are viewing the website on.
If we want to specifically target mobile devices.
(color) { }
@media (min-color: 1) { } / @media 
The number is related to how many bits per color component of the output device. It apllies to all color devices.

@media (min-color-index: 256) { } 
How many color a device can display 

@media (monochrome) { } 
It apllies to all color devices. Similar to the min-color:1

@media (scan: progressive) { }
This is for television type devices. There are two values here - progressive or interlaced.

@media (grid) { } 
Determine rather the device is grid or bitmap
grid - tty terminal or phone display but was one fixed font, if that is the case the value of the grid will be 1. Otherwise is a bitmap and a value of the grid will be 0.

4.4 Animating on Breakpoints
============================

Create a animated effect that will occur when gets to a break point using media queries.

Animating the title.
