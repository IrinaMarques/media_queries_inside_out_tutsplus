4.1 Resolution Features
========================

To make images look good in devices with less pixels:

.feature {
background-image: url('.../images/images.jpg'); }

Only browsers like chrome gonna support that option but if we added a ',' e can include a new resulution.
@media 
(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
(min-resolution: 192dpi) {
    .feature { background-image: url('../images/image-hires.jpg') } }

What will be doing is loading a diferent image that's higher resolution that's going to look good on the high resolution displays such as the render display for apple devices. 

================================
4.2 Orientation and Aspect Ratio
================================

Orientation of the screen - landscape or portrait.

We can create a different layout or a different column structure depending on the user is in portrait or landscape mode.

To costumize the break points for the portrait and landscape we can use the aspect-ratio media feature in CSS.

aspect-ratio is based on numbers separated by a slash 
ex. aspect-ratio: 1/1 - it will be a square, width is the same size as the height. This occurs on one specific width and height, for ex. 499px x 499px

If we set to max-aspect-ratio: 1/1 when it comes to 499px x 499px it stays on portrait mode. 

When the width is larger then the height it turns landscape.
When the height is larger then the width it turns portrait.
