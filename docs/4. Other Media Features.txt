========================
4.1 Resolution Features
========================

To make images look good in devices with less pixels:

.feature {
background-image: url('.../images/images.jpg'); }

Only browsers like chrome gonna support that option but if we added a ',' e can include a new resulution.
@media 
(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),
(min-resolution: 192dpi) {
    .feature { background-image: url('../images/image-hires.jpg') } }

What will be doing is loading a diferent image that's higher resolution that's going to look good on the high resolution displays such as the render display for apple devices.
