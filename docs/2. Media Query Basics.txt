2.1 Viewport Width

In HTML head of the document we add the meta tag:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

2.2 Simplifying Designs for Print
=================================

We create a new css document called print - print.css and then we can remove all the things that aren't needed when we print the document.
We can remove de nav bar and the advertisement.

In the new print.css we put the main-menu and the advertisement with display: none.
Then in the HTML document we add a new link to the new stylesheet, the print.css.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/print.css" media="print">

This is how we can use an html media query to create a separate stylesheet for when we want to print the webpage.

Even when we are printing out the page our original stylesheet are still being taken to consideration the styles in the styles.css are still being used.
